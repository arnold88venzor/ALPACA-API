In order to determine portfolio health the current project was 
dedicated to provide insight on current savings compiled of shares and cryptocurrencies to determine if there is enough 
assests to cover an emergency fund. The second half consists of fetching ALPACA historical data to 
forcast investment values of bonds stocks and cryptocurrencies over 30 years using 500 simulations. 
This was possible by using Python and ALPACA Trading API. Charts are provided in order to vizualize the direction of the assets.
